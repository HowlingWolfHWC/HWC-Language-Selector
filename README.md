# HWC's Language Selector
This small tool allows changing the language locale to the one you pick.
I made this ELF as a tool to help fix a regression I found on PCSX2 while testing the new XEB+ dashboard. More information here: https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/issues/4902

Anyway, I hope this also helps some people to use foreign languages consoles where the region does not support them while they wait for XtremeEliteBoot+ which will feature custom language locale settings. Enjoy!
